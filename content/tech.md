Through a serendipitous job offer from a friend at University, Chris began a career in Technology installing bespoke, outdoor-ready wireless and internet solutions into music festivals. After two years working at the likes of Glastonbury, Leeds and T in the Park, he moved into IT Support, specialising in Apple machines. After a 7 year term at the University of Chester, working in imaging and deployment, Chris is now a Team Leader at [razorblue](https://www.razorblue.com/), a national Managed Service Provider.

Moving forward, Chris is interested in solving problems with Technology, rather than solving the problems it causes. With interests in Apple & Linux, drone piloting, and hobbyist communities like home-theatre PCs and raspberry pi; Chris is hoping to moving into a creative space in technology; with a specific interest in getting outdoors whilst doing it.

His Technology career is best summarised on LinkedIn:
